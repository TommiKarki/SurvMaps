# SurvMaps
Creates surveillance chloropleth maps, includes EU/EEA SpatialPolygonDataframe. Requires data with defined GEO_ID variable in specific format. 

Note that due to the use of grid for legend and the small inlets for non-visible countries, mapping is not superswift and elements appear one by one to the graph.
