# SurvMaps
DEVELOPMENT VERSION with limited documentation and functionality.

Creates surveillance chloropleth maps for EU/EEA countries, includes SpatialPolygonDataframe to plot EU/EEA country data. Requires data file with defined GEO_ID variable in specific format, as well as spatial data in pre-defined format.

Further tools to work with different spatial data, different levels of spatial data, and point maps; to be added later.

Note that due to the use of grid for legend and the small inlets for non-visible countries, mapping is not superswift and elements appear one by one to the graph. Also, the alignment of the legend, as well as fontsize, depends on the width x height. Current ideal dimensions approximately 1000x680.
